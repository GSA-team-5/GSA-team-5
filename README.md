# GSA-team-5 - Satisfaction Looker

## Hack Name
PBS Tenant Satisfaction

[Satisfaction Looker mvp-0.1.0] (http://localhost:4000)

## Primary Challenge
Are there relationships between tenant satisfaction and the cost of managing the tenant's building?  From this insight the goal is to help the government make better resourcing decisions that maximize value on each dollar spent and minimize waste.

## Secondary Challenge
Identifying other energy cost and consumption outliers.

## Team Vision
- Identify an initial algorithm that attempts to correlate various cost metrics to the various tenant satisfaction ratings.
- Identify the target users of the application to have a more personalized design approach.
- The team believes there is not a single view that answers the primary challenge succinctly (at least not known) so we want to build an intuitive user experience that allows the user to richly view the data and through various snapshots make better heuristical conclusion.
